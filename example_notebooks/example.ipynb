      "Portable Document Format (PDF) Portable Document Format standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.[2][3] Based on the PostScript language, each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a wide variety of media, including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information needed to display it. PDF has its roots in \"The Camelot Project\" initiated by Adobe co-founder John Warnock in 1991.[4] \"[PDF] was standardized as ISO 32000 in 2008.[5] The last internal application/pdf/[1] edition as ISO 32000-2:2020 was published in December 2020.[6] application/x-pdf application/x-gzpdf PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring Type code PDF. [1] (including a single trailing space) elements, interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields, layers, rich media (including video content), three-dimensional objects using U3D or HRC, and various other data formats. The \"IDF\" specification also provides for encryption and digital signatures, file attachments, and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features. Initial release June 15, 1993 Latest release 20 PDF/A PDF/E:PDF/A History PDF/T:PDF/X Standard ISO 32000-2 The development of PDF began in 1991 when John Warnock wrote a paper for a project then called Websie named Camelot, in which he proposed the creation of a simplified version of PostScript called Interchange PostScript (IPS).[7] Unlike traditional PostScript, which was tightly focused on rendering print jobs to output devices, IPS would be optimized for displaying pages to any screen and any platform.[1] Adobe Systems made the PDF specification available free of charge in 1993. In the early years PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows, and competed with several other formats, including DjVu, Envoy, Common Ground Digital Paper, Karalon Replica and even Adobe's own PostScript format.\n",

      "PDF was a proprietary format controlled by Adobe until it was released as an open standard on July 1, 2003, and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 32000-1:2008,[8][9] at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of volunteer industry experts. In 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO 32000-1 granting royalty-free rights for all patents owned by Adobe necessary to make, use, sell, and distribute PDF- compliant implementations.[10]\n",

      "PDF 1.7, the sixth edition of the PDF specification that became ISO 32000-1, includes some proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe such as Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) and JavaScript extension for Acrobat, which are referenced by ISO 32000-1 as normative and indispensable for the full implementation of the ISO 32000-1 specification.[11] These proprietary technologies are not standardized, and their specification is published only on Adobe's website.[11][14] Many of them are not supported by popular third-party implementations of PDF.\n",

      "ISO published version 2.0 of PDF: ISO/IEC 32000-2 in early 2007, was available for purchase, replacing the free specification provided by Adobe.[5] In December 2020, the second edition of PDF 2.0, ISO 32000-2:2020, was published, with clarifications, corrections, and critical updates to normative references.[6] (ISO 32000-2 does not include any proprietary technologies as normative references).[17] In April 2023 the PDF Association made ISO 32000-2 available for download free of charge.[15]\n",

The author notes that they have not achieved much in terms of wealth or fame but are content with their current situation.\n",

      "*   **Elegant sentence structure**: Sentences are carefully crafted to convey complex ideas and emotions in a clear, concise manner.\n",
